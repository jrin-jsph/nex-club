# NexClub - College Club Management System

A desktop-based application to streamline and centralize the management of student clubs and activities within a college campus.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

In many colleges, club-related communication and coordination are often scattered across informal channels like WhatsApp, leading to inefficiencies and missed opportunities for student engagement. **NexClub** addresses this problem by offering a structured, role-based desktop system to manage all club-related interactions.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features

- **Role-based login system**

  - **Students** can log in using their college ID to:
    - View club information
    - Check event announcements
    - Apply for club recruitment
  - **Club Leaders** can:
    - Manage club updates
    - Post event notices
    - Handle application forms
    - Notify students about interviews and events

- **User-Friendly Interface**

  - Built with **Java Swing** for a responsive and interactive desktop experience.

- **Hybrid Storage System**

  - **SQL database** used for structured data like user credentials and event records.
  - **File-based storage** used for documents such as application forms, notices, and club-specific content.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Java (Swing for GUI)
- SQL (Database for persistent data)
- File-based storage (for forms, notices, etc.)

## ðŸŽ“ Academic Relevance

This project demonstrates key programming concepts such as:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
